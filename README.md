Welcome to "Itemazon" — The Future of Shopping, Reinvented

In the beginning, there was "Bookazon" — a repository abandoned, left to collect dust in the vast recesses of GitHub. Its potential? Unrealized. Its vision? Narrow. Whoever created it clearly didn’t foresee the future. They didn’t think beyond books. But we did. We saw an opportunity to evolve, to disrupt, to bring about something far grander than what the original creators could ever have imagined.

And thus, Itemazon was born.

Immediately after forking the repository, we created a UML diagram like principled software engineers. We realized that certain classes like User were trying to implement too many methods and hoarding methods and functionality that should belong in other classes. Aside from that, little issues like duplicated code, convoluted one line functions, and other redundant or outright meaningless lines of code were littered throughout. 

After a thorough analysis of the original code, we started making a list of issues with corresponding proposed solutions and adding them onto github. Our backlog manager went straight to work and labeled each issue with its type and priority. To ensure the most efficient workflow, we utilized proper git techniques such as creating branches to address each issue and created pull requests after implementing the fix. Almost all pull requests were reviewed/merged into the main branch by someone other than the person who created the pull request. 

The addition of new classes such as Address, Subscriptions, and Item truly modified this into a product that will revolutionize the world. Unlike the original code, we followed strict SOLID design principles. This allowed us to make the code more accessible for modification in the future and ensure that nothing breaks when we implement new ideas. This new flexibility even allowed us to add new features such as expanding the system to support new media types, including audiobooks, DVDs, and e-books.

This all accumulated to the creation of Itemazon, a much more revolutionary service that currently sells books but one day will sell any item to any person at any time. Welcome to Itemazon!
